# DirectX SDK Samples

> I've created an 'official' location to host the legacy DirectX SDK Samples on GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-SDK-Samples. These are all the original samples updated to use the `Microsoft.DXSDK.D3DX` NuGet package to get the D3DX9, D3DX10, and D3DX11 library.

> This repo contains only a subset of legacy DirectX SDK samples. These were reworked extensively to remove all use of legacy D3DX11, modernize the C++ code, and generally have been 'mucked with' for years. I'm keeping these around for reference as they are significantly different than the ones in the legacy DirectX SDK. I renamed this repo to make it distinct from a fork of the Microsoft org repo.

This repo contains Direct3D 11, XInput, and XAudio2 samples that originally shipped in the legacy DirectX SDK. These are all **Windows desktop** applications for Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or later.

They have all been cleaned up to build using the Windows 10 SDK, and _DO NOT_ require the DirectX SDK to build. Projects for Visual Studio 2019 are provided, and can be upgraded to VS 2022.
